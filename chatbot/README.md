# VOR AI Chatbot Extension

Chat with our AI chatbot directly in VS‚ÄØCode. This allows developers to interact with the VOR AI chatbot to get help with implementation, `.strm` coding questions, creating processes, and more right within their development environment. The extension opens a Webview that displays the VOR Angular chat UI, enabling users to communicate with the AI chatbot seamlessly.

This extension is designed to work with the VOR CLI, which must be installed and configured on your system. It automatically handles OIDC token generation for secure access to the chatbot. Be sure to have the VOR CLI installed and logged in on your machine before using this extension.

**Important**: If you send a message and the chatbot takes forever (more than 2 minutes) to respond, it is an unlikely but possible bug with the authentication token generation. In this case, please run `vor login` manually in your terminal to ensure you have a valid token, and then press **Ctrl+Shift+P** and select **Reload Window** to refresh the extension, and then try sending your message again.

## Installation

### From the Marketplace (future)

Currently not available on the Marketplace, but will be soon. Once available, you can install it directly from the VS‚ÄØCode Marketplace by searching for "VOR Chatbot" and installing the extension.

```text
ext install vor-chatbot
```

### From VSIX

Recommended for local development or testing:

1. Run locally to package:

   ```bash
   npm install -g vsce
   vsce package
   # ‚Üí creates: vor-chatbot-1.0.0.vsix
   ```

2. In VS‚ÄØCode, press **‚áß‚åòP** / **Ctrl+Shift+P** ‚Üí **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** ‚Üí select your `.vsix`.

> Make sure that the VS Code instance you are installing the extension into is running on the machine where VOR CLI is installed and configured, otherwise the extension will not be able to generate the OIDC token required for authentication!

---

## Configuration

Open **File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings**, search **‚ÄúVOR Chatbot‚Äù**, and set:

| Setting    | Default                               | Description                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Base URL` | `https://vor-02.vsd.frgrisk.com:8081` | Base URL of your VOR server (must be reachable and running `vor` CLI). |

Or in your `settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "vorChatbot.baseUrl": "https://my-vor-host.example.com:8081",
}
```

Alternatively, search for the **VOR Chatbot** extension and click on the gear icon to access the **Extension Settings**. You can then modify the `Base URL` setting directly from there.

---

## Usage

1. Install the extension as described above.
2. Ensure you have the VOR CLI installed and logged in on your machine (`vor login`).
3. Open your VS‚ÄØCode editor.
4. Click the **VOR icon** in the VS Code Activity Bar to open the sidebar.
5. The chatbot will appear in the sidebar view.
6. The extension will automatically:
   - Execute `vor create token` in the background to get an authentication token.
   - If no token can be created, it will show an error message prompting you to run `vor login`.
   - Otherwise, it will load the chat interface from your configured `vorChatbot.baseUrl`.

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- VS‚ÄØCode
- Node.js (for packaging / dev)
- `vor` CLI installed & in your `$PATH`

### Run locally

1. **Open this folder** in your local VS‚ÄØCode.
2. Press **F5** ‚Üí a new **Extension Development Host** window opens with your extension active. Alternatively, you can use the **Run** panel to start the extension automatically.
3. In the Dev Host window, run **‚áß‚åòP** / **Ctrl+Shift+P** ‚Üí **VOR: Open Chatbot** to sanity‚Äëcheck.

### Build & watch

```bash
npm install
npm run compile     # one‚Äëoff build
npm run watch       # continuous (add in your package.json scripts if you like)
```

For the extension to work, you must have the `vor` CLI installed and logged in on your machine. The extension will automatically handle OIDC token generation using the `vor create token` command.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **‚ÄúFailed to create token‚Äù** ‚Üí ensure `vor login` has been completed and `vor` is in your PATH.
- **No extension in Install‚ÄëLocal list** ‚Üí be sure your Dev Host (F5) is still open on your local machine when you invoke **Install Local Extension on Host‚Ä¶**.
- **404 or CORS errors in iframe** ‚Üí verify `vorChatbot.baseUrl` matches your running Angular server (including protocol & port).
- **Webview blank** ‚Üí check DevTools: in the Webview window press **‚å•‚åòI** / **Ctrl+Shift+I** to open its console & network logs.
